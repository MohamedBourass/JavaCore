	//Interface allows 2 teams to work together with a kind of contract which is the interface ==> Check how mocks are running for e.g
	//Functional interface is an interface that contains a single abstract method
	//Functional interfaces are used as the basis for lambda expressions in functional programming
	//An interface which has an abstract method + a default method + a static method is a functional interface!!
	//A lambda expression is a block of code that get passed around like an anonymous method
	//The Predicate interface allows to test our lambda function quicker
	//Polymorphism is the ability of a single interface to support multiple underlying forms
	
	//Pattern Singleton, Immutable, Builder, Factory
