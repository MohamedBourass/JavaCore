	// A collection is a group of objects contained in a single object
	// There are 4 main interfaces in the Java Collections Framework
	// List: a list is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicate entries 
	// Set: a set is a collection that does not allow duplicate entries
	// Queue: a queue is a collection that orders its elements in a specific order for processing
	// Map: a map is a collection that maps key to values, with no duplicate keys allowed
	// Note* : Map does not implement the Collection interface but it is considered as part of the Java Collection Framework

	
	// A static array cannot be resized
	// Most dynamic array implementation use static arrays internally
	// String are a sequence of characters
	// HashTable is thread-safe but HashMap is not thread-safe
	// Vector and HashTable are old version, nowadays we use Collections.synchronizedMap, synchronizedList etc.
	// Comparable is a functional interface since it has only one abstract method "compareTo"
	// Comparator to sort object that did not implement the FI Comparable, or you want to sort objects in different ways at different times
